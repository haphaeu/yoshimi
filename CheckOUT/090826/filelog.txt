CheckOUT - under development

this program searches and reports the crashed flexcom cases.

There are three variants:

1- CheckOUT
2- CheckOUTsimple
3- CheckOUTfull

1- CheckOUT
===========
Reads a single folder and outputs all crashed cases verbosely, i.e,
results are presented per analysis type (T, S and D), the number of
crashed cases and the name of each crashed case. Results are reported
on screen and in a results file.

2- CheckOUTsimple
=================
Reads a single folder and creates a simpler output of the crashed
cases, i.e, only report the file names of the crashed cases. 
More usefull for a batch run. Results are reported on screen and 
in a results file.

3- CheckOUTfull
===============
Reads the full subfolder structure from which the program is run from.
Reports the names of each folder checked and if crashed cases are found,
their names are reported below the folder name. No output file is created,
the results are only shown on screen


How to use it:
==============

In the command prompt, just type the program name in the directory you
want to check:

CheckOUT
or
CheckOUTsimple
or
CHECKOUTfull

Note that the 'CheckOUTfull' might take several minutes to run of the 
subfolder structure is big.
