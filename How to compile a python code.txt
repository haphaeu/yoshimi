HOW TO COMPILE A PYTHON CODE (.PY) INTO AN EXECUTABLE FILE (.EXE)
=================================================================

Requirements:

These softwares must be installed in the machine in which the code will 
be compiled:

- Active Python (W:\Software\Python)
- py2exe (W:\Software\Python\py2exe)

How to compile:

Compilation of the python code is done with the py2exe library.
Detailed instructions of how to use it is found at
www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial

Basically you need:

1-Edit the file setup.py and change *only* the name of the file to be 
compiled
2-In the shell, call >>python setup.py py2exe

You'll see lots of output and in the end the code should be compiled in the 
folder "dist"

Important: To run the compiled program, you'll need 3 files:
1-The compiled .EXE file
2-PYTHON26.dll
3-library.zip

Copy all these 3 files to *the same folder* and add this folder to the system
path.
For example, the files can be copied to Z:\RADMAP

Notes:
-If you need to compile more than one python code in the same folder, just add
 them to the same setup.exe
 
-The files PYTHON26.DLL and LIBRARY.ZIP are likely to be the same for 
compilations of different codes, so only one of those files should be ok in the
RADMAP folder.*But* no extensive testing is done in this regarding.
