Results Visualiser

This application imports data from rlc (repeated lowering control) module and plot samples for the available sea states.

This is a quick, messy and lazy help for the app =^)

===

File->Open... 
Select a results file from a lifting analysis using rlc, typically called 'Results.txt'. 

Edit->Copy
The current plot is copied into the clipboard. Note that the plot can also be saved to file using the toolbar under the plot.

Multiple sea states can be selectedat a time. Note that the list of Tp depends on the selected Hs.

Fit is a best line fit to the sample using least squares method. Only show when y-axis is log-log.

The rest should be straightforward...
