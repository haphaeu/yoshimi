Results Visualiser for Probabilistic Lifting Analysis

This application imports data from rlc (repeated lowering control) module and plot samples for the available sea states.

The objective to to aid in checking the results by assessing the quality of the statistical fits.

===

File->Open... 
Select a results file from a lifting analysis using rlc, typically called 'Results.txt'. 

Edit->Copy
The current plot is copied into the clipboard. Note that the plot can also be saved to file using the toolbar under the plot.

Multiple sea states can be selectedat a time. Note that the list of Tp depends on the selected Hs.

Fit is a best line fit to the sample using MLE, ME or least squares method. Only show when y-axis is log-log.

Confidence intervals are calculated for the user input "Level" using a bootstrap technique for the quantile (shown as error bars) and for the fitted model. 

The rest should be straightforward...
