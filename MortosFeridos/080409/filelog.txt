2HFIXKEYS - under development

this program searches the crashed static and dynamic cases and re-run flexcom 
for those using the user input parameters.

How to use it:
==============

copy the files MortosFeridos.py and controla.dat to the analysis folder with the crashed cases.
edit controla.dat according to the following commands:

mandatory commands:

   *AnalysisType type 

where type can be S, Q or D
   
   *Parameters
       ts1   tol1   torque1
       ts2   tol2   torque2
       
where 
 ts is time-step, tol is tolerance and torque is minimum torque value
 put as many lines as you wish with a set of three values
 
optional:
   *UserName - username (as per e-mail, without @...), sends you a message when program finishes.

after that, call in the command prompt:

        python MortosFeridos.py

How does it work?
=================

The program firstly searches though all the flexcom OUT files in the 
directory, according to the analysis type defined in the command 
*AnalysisType, and builds a list of the crashed cases. 

Then, flexcom is rerun using the parameters listed in the command 
*Parameter until the case run successfully.

A file called MortosFeridosLog.txt is created with an echo of the DAT 
file, the parameters for which each case run and finally, the cases 
still crashed.
