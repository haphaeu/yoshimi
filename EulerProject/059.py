Project Euler - Problem 59

Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred 
standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). 
For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.

A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to 
ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. 
The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key
on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107,
then 107 XOR 42 = 65.

For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without
both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified 
method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the 
message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the 
message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key
for security, but short enough to be memorable.

Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower 
case characters. Using cipher1.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain
text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of
the ASCII values in the original text.

password 'god':
(The Gospel of John, chapter 1) 
1 In the beginning the Word already existed. He was with God, and he was God. 
2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 He created everything there is. Nothing
exists that he didn't make. 4 Life itself was in him, and this life gives light
to everyone. 5 The light shines through the darkness, and the darkness can 
never extinguish it. 6 God sent John the Baptist 7 to tell everyone about the 
light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony. 8 John himself 
was not the light; he was only a witness to the light. 9 The one who is the 
true light, who gives light to everyone, was going to come into the world. 
10 But although the world was made through him, the world didn't recognize him 
when he came. 11 Even in his own land and among his own people, he was not 
accepted. 12 But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to
become children of God. 13 They are reborn! This is not a physical birth 
resulting from human passion or plan, this rebirth comes from God. 14 So the 
Word became human and lived here on earth among us. He was full of unfailing 
love and faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the only Son of
the Father.

=====================
ok, and how do I know that the password is 'god'
Premises:
- we know that the message is a text
- texts contains lots of spaces 
- ASCII for space is 32 (ord(' ')=32)
Method:
- check in the code the numbers with larger occurrence
- 3 numbers shall have significantly larger occurrence,
as the password in this case has 3 letters
- check with which number a XOR must be done with the 3 largest
occurences numbers to get 32 (space)
Results:
- one can see that 68, 71 and 79 ocurr quite more often than any other
- 68 ^ 100 = 32 => chr(100)= d
- 71 ^ 103 = 32 => chr(103)= g
- 79 ^ 111 = 32 => chr(111)= o 
- god!
